**Travel - Problem to be solved**

**Background:**

BusyFlights is a flights search solution which aggregates flight results initially from 2 different suppliers (CrazyAir and ToughJet). A future iteration (not part of the test) may add more suppliers.


**What is required:**

Use this repository as a base to implement the Busy Flights service that should produce an aggregated result from both CrazyAir and ToughJet.

The use of JPA and database is not required; you can hardcode/mock data instead.

The result should be a JSON response which contains a list of flights ordered by fare which has the following attributes:

**Busy Flights API**

**Request**

| Name | Description |

| origin | 3 letter IATA code(eg. LHR, AMS) |

| numberOfPassengers | Maximum 4 passengers |

**Response**

| destinationAirportCode | 3 letter IATA code(eg. LHR, AMS) |

| arrivalDate | ISO_DATE_TIME format |

The service should connect to the both the suppliers using HTTP.
